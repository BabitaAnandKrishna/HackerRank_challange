'''ABC is right triangle, 90degree at B.
Therefore, <angleABC=90 degree

Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC .

You are given the lengths AB  and BC.
Your task is to find AngleMBC  (angle ,0 degree as shown in the figure) in degrees.

Input Format

The first line contains the length of side AB .
The second line contains the length of side BC.

Constraints
0<AB<=100
0<BC<=100

Lengths AB  and BC are natural numbers.
Output Format

Output Angle MBC  in degrees.

Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.

Examples:
If angle is 56.5000001°, then output 57°.
If angle is 56.5000000°, then output 57°.
If angle is 56.4999999°, then output 56°.'''
